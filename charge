1 SDM450+pmi8952+pm8953 在支持power path模式下(usb同时给电池和系统供电)，充满电之后电池电压会掉落。
原因分析：When the BATFET is open (after charging has been terminated or disabled) and VBATT is high, itis observed that a few mAs of battery current (varies from part to part)
is discharged into the PMIC. The current can go up to a maximum of 6 mA on a few random samples tested.
There is no major system impact.
There will be a state of charge (SoC) drop due to the leakage. This can be masked through software, and the UI can be made to display 100% for improved user experience, 
until VBAT reaches the recharge threshold. This feature can be enabled by adding qcom,hold-soc-while-full property in the .dtsi file
